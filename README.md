# packLZH
A very basic compression tool for any file, based on LZH coding. This is mainly intended as educational code or base for bigger projects.

packLZH is a universal file compression tool. It is based on packHUF and adds the well known LZ77 algorithm to the mix. Compression ratios highly depend on file content. In most cases, they should be a little worse than those reached by packARI, but at faster compression speeds and much faster decompression speeds.

This has basically not been tested at all, so proceed at your own risk. You may freely use packLZH and itâ€™s source code under the terms of the LGPL.
